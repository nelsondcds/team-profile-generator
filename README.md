# team-profile-generator by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator. The challenge consists of creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a team profile index.html file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Requirements included using test-driven development, and the creation of specified classes to pass specified tests.
